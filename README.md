Frontend Mentor - Social Links Profile Card

This is my solution to the Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal was to build a clean, accessible, and responsive card that displays a user profile with social links.

🛠️ Built With

    Semantic HTML5

    Tailwind CSS

    Flexbox

    Custom colors

    Mobile-first responsive layout

💡 What I Learned

    How to create a vertically centered card layout using flex, min-h-screen, and items-center.

    Styling custom buttons with Tailwind utilities (bg-gray-700, hover:bg-gray-600, rounded-xl, etc.).

    Better understanding of font styling (font-bold, tracking-tight) and color contrast in dark mode.

    Using Tailwind to quickly prototype UI without writing custom CSS.



🚀 Continued Development

    Add animations or hover effects for buttons.

    Make the links dynamic with icons and user data.

    Try implementing light/dark theme toggle.

    Refactor for accessibility improvements (e.g., ARIA labels).
